      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sunlight is made up of all colors of the rainbow.**  These colors have different wavelengths, with blue having a shorter wavelength than red.\n",
      "* **When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the tiny gas molecules.** These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
      "* **Shorter wavelengths (like blue) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths (like red).** This means blue light is scattered in all directions by the air molecules.\n",
      "* **We see this scattered blue light coming from all directions in the sky.** This is why the sky appears blue, especially on clear days.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a helpful analogy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine shining a flashlight through a room filled with smoke. The light will scatter, and you'll see the smoke glowing. Similarly, sunlight scatters off the air molecules, and we see the scattered blue light.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is the sky red at sunset?**\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to travel through more atmosphere to reach us. This means more blue light is scattered away, leaving the longer wavelengths (red and orange) to reach our eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you'd like to know more about this phenomenon! \n",
